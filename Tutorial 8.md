### Tutorial 8:  Priority Queue

#### Question 1
##### Describe the main difference between Queue and PriorityQueue.
```plaintext
A priority queue has a largest-in, first-out behavior while a regular queue is a first-in and first-out (FIFO) data structure.

In a priority queue, elements are assigned with priorities. When accessing elements, the element with the highest priority is removed first.
In a regular queue is a first,elements are appended to the end of the queue and are removed from the beginning of the queue. 
```

#### Question 2
##### Briefly provide THREE (3) real-life example in using PriorityQueue
```plaintext
i) The emergency room in a hospital assigns priority numbers to patients; the patient with the highest priority is treated first.
2) To-Do List. Tasks with urgent deadlines or those that are critical for your work or personal life might be prioritized over less important tasks.
3) Airport Security Check: Think of a security checkpoint at an airport. Passengers with disabilities, small children, or urgent flights might be given priority over others.
