### Tutorial 7: Queue

#### Question 1
##### 1. Name four everyday examples of a queue other than those discussed during lecture.
```plaintext
1) Airplane boarding
2) Theme Park Ride Queue
3) Restaurant Waiting Line
4) Drive-thru Line
```

#### 2. What is the difference between a queue and stack? 
```plaintext
Queue
- An item removed from the queue is the first element that was added into the queue
- has FIFO (first-in-first-out) ordering.

Stack
- the elements are accessed, inserted, and deleted only from the end, called the top, of the stack
- has LIFO (last-in-first-out) ordering.
```

#### 3. Use the following code segment to answer parts (a) through (c):
```plaintext
Queue<Integer> q = new Queue<Integer>();
Scanner keyIn = new Scanner(System.in);
  for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
      if (keyIn.nextBoolean())
        System.out.print(i + " ");
      else
      q.enqueue(i);
  }
}
while (!q.isEmpty())
  System.out.print(q.dequeue() + " ");
  System.out.println();
```

##### (a) What is the output for the following input sequence?
##### true false false true true
```plaintext
1 4 5 2 3 
```

##### (b) Is it possible to have output: 1 3 5 4 2? If yes, give an input sequence that produces the output; or else, provide justification to your answer
```plaintext
No it is not possible. The code can only produce two sublist of increasing values. 1 3 5 is an increasing order, but 4 2 is in a descending order.
```

##### (c) Give at least three input sequences that produce the output: 1 2 3 4 5
```plaintext
Input 1:
true true true true true

Input 2:
false false false false false

input 3:
true true true true false
```

##### 4. Hand trace a queue X through the following operations:
```plaintext
 X.enqueue(new Integer(14));
 X.enqueue(new Integer(3));
 X.enqueue(new Integer(5));
 Object Y = X.dequeue();
 X.enqueue(new Integer(7));
 X.enqueue(new Integer(9));
 Y = X.dequeue();
 X.enqueue(new Integer(2));
 X.enqueue(new Integer(4));
```

##### Given the resulting queue X above, what would be the result of each of the following?

##### a) X.front();
```plaintext
5
```

##### b) Y = X.dequeue();
#####    X.enqueue(new Integer(10));
#####    X.front();
```plaintext
7
```

##### c) Y = X.dequeue();
```plaintext
Y = 7
```

##### d) X.front();
```plaintext
9
```

##### Provide and explain three operations / functions of Linked List based Queue that you can add to the GenericQueue class, other than those discussed in the lecture (i.e., enqueue, dequeue and getSize â€“ from Slide 10 in the lecture slide).
```plaintext
1) peek() method, where it returns the first element in the queue without actually removing it.

2) isEmpty() method, where it returns a boolean value to check if the queue is empty.

3) clear() method, where it clears the queue by setting the head and the tail pointer towards null.

4) indexOf(T element), where it returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in the queue

5) remove(T element), where it removes the first occurrence of the specified element in the queue

```
